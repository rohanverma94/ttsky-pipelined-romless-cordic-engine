# ROM-less CORDIC engine for Tiny Tapeout
This ROM-less cordic engine is written for [Tiny Tapeout SKY25a shuttle](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-sky-25a). It implements a [COordinate Rotation Digital Computer or CORDIC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5089431) which work on a 16-bit signed fixed-point input Q3.16 (1 sign bit, 3 integer bits, and 12 fraction bits). This engine utilizes SPI-slave interface to receive four 16-bit signed fixed-point inputs (atan‚ÇÄ, alpha, x, y) and returns three 16-bit signed fixed-point outputs (alpha, cosŒ∏, sinŒ∏).

While building the foundation for math processors on ASIC, we learnt a lot. 

[Rohan Sundar](https://github.com/rsundar) and [Kasetty Praveen Kumar](https://github.com/Kasetty-Praveen-Kumar) were instrumental in simplifying the CORDIC engine‚Äôs math to enable a ROM-less design, while [Vicharak Team](#Vicharak's-Engineering-Team) engineered a good synthesizable RTL that has been thoroughly tested and integrates beautifully with open-source tools.

## üôè Acknowledgment

Huge thanks to [**Vicharak's Engineering Team**](https://vicharak.in) üèÜ   for their expertise in **mathematics, RTL design, and testbench simulations**. 

This tapeout simply wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without their hard work and support.
